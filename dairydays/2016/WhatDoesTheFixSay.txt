VERSE 1

Dog goes woof, cat goes meow,
Bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeek.
Cow goes moo, frog goes croak,
And the elephant goes toot.

[Harmony]
Ducks says quack,  And fish go blub

And the seal goes ow ow ow

[Harmony]
But there's one sound, that no one knows

What does the fox say?

CHORUS

Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringding...
   What the fox say
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!
   What the fox say
Hatee hatee hatee ho
   What the fox sy
Yup yup yup a dup a dup
   What the fox say

VERSE 2

Big blue eyes, pointy nose,
Chasing mice and digging holes,
Tiny paws, up the hill,
Suddenly you're standing still,

[Harmony]
Your fur is red, so beautiful,

Like an angel in disguise,

[Harmony]
But if you meet, a friendly horse,

Will you communicate by

[Harmony]
mo-o-o-o-orse? Mo-o-o-o-orse? Mo-o-o-o-orse?

How will you speak to that

[Harmony]
ho-o-o-o-orse? Ho-o-o-o-orse? Ho-o-o-o-orse?

What does the fox say?


CHORUS

Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow!
   What the fox say
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!
   What the fox say
Ah-hee-ahee ha-hee!
   What the fox say
Ah-oo-oo-oo-ooo!
   What does the fox say?


BRIDGE/OUTRO
The secret of the fox, Ancient mystery,
Somewhere deep in the woods,
I know you're hiding,

What is your sound?
Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery

What do you say...
You're my guardian angel

Hiding in the woods,

What is your sound...
Will we ever know?

I want to...
I want to...
I want to know!
