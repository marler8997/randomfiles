
Verse 1:

When my cow needs a milking
My one solution is to squeeze her so gently
Yeah, Yeah

She is always in my pasture
Right there when I want her

All these other cows are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone, and they say

PreChorus:
Do you need me?
Do you need my milky?
Do I make you feel like squeezing?
I'm like no Not really 'cause

Chorus:
Oh I think that I found myself a diary cow
Let's me squeeze her for milk, never runs out
Oh I think that I found myself a diary cow
Always comes when I call, never goes out

Verse 2:
She walks like a hefer
She grants my wishes like white milk in a bottle
Yeah, Yeah

She is always in my pasture
Right there when I want her

All these other cows are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone, and they say

[PreChorus & Chorus]

Bridge:

Mmmmm she gives me milk and confection
baby did I mention
You're the only cow for me
no I don't need the next one

Mama loves you to she thinks
I made the right selection

now All that's left to do is just for
me to drink my milk...and [Chorus]
