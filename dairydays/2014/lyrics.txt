All the single babies

All the single babies (x4)
Now put your hands up

I'm makin a fuss
I just woke up
I'm doin my own baby thing

Get me out of this crib
And give me my bib
I'm ready for my peaches and cream

And I aint gonna lie
I'm gonna start to cry
Unless you give me attention

I'll just cry my tears
I'm only one year
So you gotta make it all about me

Cause if you like it then should put a BIB on it
If you like it then should put a BIB on it
Don't be mad once you see there's SPIT on it
Cause if you like it then should put a BIB on it

Wah Wah Wah...

If you like it then should put a BIB on it
If you like it then should put a BIB on it
Don't be mad once you see there's SPIT on it
Cause if you like it then should put a BIB on it

Happy

It might seem crazy what I'm bout to say
But I'm a baby and I'm here to say

I'm in a choo choo that could go to space
With my bear, like I don't care, baby by the way

   [Cause I'm a baby]
I ain't got a job right now cause you take care of my needs
   [Cause I'm a baby]
If I need to go pee pee I know that you're changin me
   [Cause I'm a baby]
Every time you feed my face you gotta say it's a plane
   [Cause I'm a baby]
I need you to dress me up and give me my favorate train

Don't look away I'm about to scream
Say pika bu, and then tickle me

If you rip some paper then I'll be your friend
Don't need no money just attention

------------------------------
Call me baby
------------------------------

I guess you're smelling that smell
Don't ask me I'll never tell
I'm just playing with my bell
It wasn't me no way




Hey I just met you
And I'm a baby
I pooped my diaper
So change it maybe

It's hard to sit down
Cause its so squishy
I pooped my diaper
So change it maybe

Baby (Justin Beiber)

Waaaaaaah...

You know you love me
You love my stare
I'll shout whenever
and you'll be there

You give me love
Sometimes I fart
But we will never ever ever by apart

What are you doing
Are you just playing?
Say googie ga ga
What are you sayin





I'm a baby
I love my mommy
She gives me kisses
My dad is Tommy

I want your milk
You want my love
And we will never ever ever be apart

But you should spank me
cause I've been naughty
Come change my diaper
Cause I went Potty

Then rub my belly
and wipe my bum bum
and get choo choo
to fill my tum tum


Baby baby baby waaaah
Baby baby baby waaaah
Baby baby baby waaaah
I poopied all over my dad
I may a poop really bad
