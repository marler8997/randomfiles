How to charge for data usage
-------------------------------------------
The infrastructure will track the cost to transfer the data for each address.
It will then calculate the DataCost for each address using this equation:

    DataCostForAddress      DataTransferredForAddress
------------------------- = -------------------------
      TotalDataCost           TotalDataTransferred


TotalDataTransferred     : The total amount of data transferred through the infrastructure
DataTransferredForAddress: The data transferred for a specific address
TotalDataCost            : The total cost to transfer all the data through the infrastructure
                           The TotalDataCost will include all costs including maintenance and profit.
DataCostForAddress       : The cost to transfer the data for a specified address


This ratio maintains equal cost among all users of the infrastructure relative to their usage.

Let's look at an example:

Suppose there is 1 million gigabytes transffered through some entities
infrastructure that has the following total cost.

TotalDataCost for 1 Month =
    20 Employees  $100,000
    Equipment     $ 20,000
    Rent          $ 10,000
    Govt. Fees.   $    300
    Profit        $  5,000
----------------------------
                  $135,300

Then if address X used 1 gigabyte, in this entity, it would be charged one millionth
of the total cost, which is 13.5 cents.




Ideas
----------------------------------------
Maintain equal rates per distance at the same speed.

I.E. 1 dollar per gigabyte mile @ 10 Mbps

This would be usefull distance traveled.








Infrastructure
-------------------------------------------

Investors will pay to put in data lines and routing stations.


Maintenance
-------------------------------------------

The infrastructure will be maintained by users of the skynet.




How to use skynet
-------------------------------------------
1. Register an address (S.P. Address)
2. You pay for the data you use
