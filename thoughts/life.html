This page documents my explorations on how I should live my life, what should I accomplish, what's my purpose?
I'm going to start off by stating the ultimate goal:

<h2>Ultimate Goal: Live my life the best I can.</h2>

<h5>Note: Assurity that I am living the correct way is very important to me personally.</h5>

The ultimate goal raises a couple questions:

<ol>
  <li>How do you know what you should do to live the best life?</li>
</ol>

However, since it is not known whether you can know anything, this question is a little to strong, let's make it weaker:

<ol>
  <li>(Weaker): How to you determine what way to live is most likely to be the best?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Risk to Reward Ratio</h2>

Determining how you should live your life is not a simple Yes or No question.
It has many variables and a balances.
It's like a gameshow, where you want the biggest prize, but each decision has risks and rewards.
You want the lowest risk to reward ratio, however, if the reward is bigger you may be willing to sacrifice this ratio.
Use the following games as an example:

You will be given a set of cups to choose from.
Under one of the cups is a prize, and the others contain nothing.
You may only select one cup, but you get to decide how many cups there are.
The more cups there are, the bigger the prize (the higher the risk, the bigger the reward).
Every person will have their own risk to reward chart, where the number of cups is on the x axis and the minimum prize they will accept for that number of cups makes up the y axis.

Let's say the prize is in terms of US dollars (assume the player wants as many US dollars as possible).
