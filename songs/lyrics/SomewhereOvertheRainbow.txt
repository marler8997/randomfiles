G        D                C
Somewhere over the rainbow
       G
Way up high
C       G
And the dreams that you dreamed of
D          Em      C
Once in a lullaby

G        D                C
Somewhere over the rainbow
           G
Blue birds fly
C       G
And the dreams that you dreamed of
D                     Em       C
Dreams really do come true ooo oooo

G                   
Someday I'll wish upon a star
    D                                 Em    C
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
G
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
    D
And high above the chimney tops
       Em                C
That's where you'll find me

    G         D               C          G
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
C       G                   
And the dreams that you dream of,
D                     Em   C
Why then oh why can't I?   I...

          G         D    C              G
Well I see trees of green and red roses too,
C               G    D           Em
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
      C              D
And I think to myself
                 G      C
What a wonderful world

          G          D
Well I see skies of blue
C             G
And clouds of white
C                      G
And the bright blessed day
D                   Em
And the dark sacred night
      C              D
And I think to myself
                 G       C
What a wonderful world

C                  D          G
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
    C           D        G
Are also on the faces of people passing by
D     Em              G
I see friends shaking hands
       Em           G
Saying, "How do you do?"
Em             G       C       D
They're really saying, I love you

Ooooooo
