Verse 1
Bm                            D
I know I can't take one more step towards you
A                              Em
'Cause all thats waiting is regret
Bm                               D
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
A                              G
You lost the love I loved the most
Em           G     D      A
I learned to live half a life
Em           G       Asus  A
And now you want me one more time


Chorus
D                     A
Who do you think you are?
                        Bm
Running 'round leaving scars
                      G
Collecting a jar of hearts
 Gm            D
Tearing love apart
D                     A
You're gonna catch a cold
                          Bm
From the ice inside your soul
                     G
Don't come back for me
Gm                    D
Who do you think you are?


Verse 2
Bm                         D
I hear you're asking all around
A                        Em
If I am anywhere to be found
Bm                     D
But I have grown too strong
A                          G
To ever fall back in your arms
Em              G     D      A
I've learned to live half a life
Em           G            Asus  A
And now you want me one more time

You're gonna catch a cold

It took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed

And now you're back

You don't get to get me back

Collecting a jar of hearts
     Gm            D
And tearing love apart
D                      A
You're gonna catch a cold
                          Bm
From the ice inside your soul
                        G
So don't come back for me
