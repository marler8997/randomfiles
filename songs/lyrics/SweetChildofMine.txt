D
She's got a smile that it seems to me
C
Reminds me of childhood memories
	G
Where everything
			D
Was as fresh as a bright blue sky
D
Now and then when I see her face
C
She takes me away to that special place
    G
And if I stared to long
       	 	D
I'd probably break down and cry

C   	     G	   	D
Whoa Oh, Sweet child o' mine
C    	 G     	     D
Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh Sweet love o' mine

C G D

D
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
C
As if they thought of rain
   G
I hate to look into those eyes
  D
And see an ounce of pain
D
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
    C
Where as a child I'd hide
      G
And pray for the thunder

And the rain
D
To quietly pass me by


C  	   G	   D
Whoa Oh, Sweet child o' mine
C    	 G     	       D
Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh Sweet love o' mine
