C                 F7    G               Em
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
Am             Am/G           F
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
C                  G        E         Am
I don't have much money but boy if I did
C              Dm        F               G
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

G                Am        F
And you can tell everybody this is your song
G           Am            F
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
Am
I hope you don't mind
Am/G                  Am/Gb               F                 
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
    C         Dm            F             G
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
