Drag
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition: "Skin Friction" is drag caused by surface roughness.  A thin layer
            of air clings to the rough surface and creates small eddies
            contributing to drag.
 
Definition: "Form Drag" is drag caused by the turbulent wake from the separation
            of airflow from the surface of a structure. Form Drag is related to
            the size and shape of the structure.

1. Parasite Drag (Caused by non-lifting portions of the helicopter moving through
               the air)

    Increases much with air speed.

    Form Drag and Skin Friction of the fuselage, cockpit, engine cowlings, rotor
    hub, landing gear, tail boom, etc.

2. Profile Drag (Caused by Skin Friction and Form Drag of the blades)

    Increases moderately with air speed and slightly with AOA

3. Induced drag (Caused by the production of lift)

    Decreases with air speed and increases with AOA

    Since the lift vector points up and slightly aft relative to the blade,
    This causes the blade to slightly drag as it spins.


Total Drag: The sum of the 3 drag forces.  The plot of air speed and the total
drag looks like a U shape.  The bottom of the U is where the lift-to-drag ratio
is the greatest and is referred to as L/Dmax.







Definition: An "airfoil" is a structure with curved surfaces designed to
give the most favorable ratio of lift to drag through the air.

Airfoils are most often associated with lift but are also used for stability
(fin), control (elevator), and thrust of propulsion (propeller or rotor).

Definition: The "chord line" of an air foil is a straight line intersecting
            the leading and trailing edges of an airfoil.

Definition: The "mean camber line" is the line given by every midpoint between
            the upper and lower surfaces of an airfoil.


Question: Why is the tachometer in percentages instead of RPMs?

   Probably to match the engine speed to the rotor speed
   
Card: Rotor/Engine Rpm (PowerON and PowerOff)

Card: Lycoming 0-360 J2A

Transmission:
  1) Mast
  2) Main Rotor Gear Box (changes direction, and reduces RPM 11:47)
  3) Tail Rotor Gear Box (changes direction and increasing RPM 3:2)
  4) Drive Shaft

  
Definition: A Freewheeling unit allows rotors to continue turning when engine stops.  R22 uses a sprag clutch for this.

Sumps


Mixture Control:
  If the helicopter gets to a high enough altitude, the mixture should be leaned because there is less air entering the carberator.
  
Carberator Ice:
  The venturi affect causes the air to be much cooler in the carberator.
  In the R22, below 18 inches MAP we must apply carberator heat because the CAT (Carberator air temparature guage) does not function at that low of power level.
  Use Carburetor heat
     1) Visible moisture
     2) OAT (Outside air temp guage) -4 to 30 degrees C.
     3) When OAT is within 15 degrees celcius of the dew point.

AOA: Angle between chord line and resultant wind

Magnus Effect: Spinning structure causes difference in air pressure producing lift (like baseball example)


Bernoulli's principle leads to Venturi Effect.

As the cross section area decreases you must increase velocity to maintain the same amount of fluid.


The Lift force is equal to the total weight of the helicopter.
Thrust is any force produced by the main rotors minus the lift.
Drag is force opposing thrust.


L/Dmax for R22 is 53 Knots


Powered flight is any type of flight where the helicopter is performing under power.

Pendular Action: Caused by over-controlling

Coning: Occurs the most with the most vertical thrust

Coriolis Effect (Law of conservation of Momentum): 
Figure Skater Effect
When the blades cone up, it brings more mass closer to the hub, causing an increase in rotor RPM

Translational lift: Improved rotor efficiency resulting from directional flight.

   ETL (Effective Translational Lift): in R22 it is 16 to 24 Knots
     A sudden transition state from no affect from transitional lift to have translational lift.
      
Induced flow: The vertical flow of air caused by the main rotor blades

Transverse Flow Effect: Occurs before ETL. Another sudden transition where half of the main rotor blades are in translational lift and half are not, causing the helicopter to roll to the right (because of gyroscopic procession)
